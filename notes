Object Localization:

	1. Image classification first
	2. Classification with localization (find where, single object)
	3. Detection (classify and localize multiple objects)


Classificaiton:
	Image -> ConvNet -> Softmax (pedestrian, car, motorcycle, background)

	Also output: bounding box (bx, by, bh, bw)
		1. bx, by is the center of the object
		2. bh: height
		3. bw: width

y = [pc]			pc -> is there an object?
	[bx]
	[by]
	[bh]
	[bw]
	[c1]			c1 -> class 1
	[c2]			c2 -> class 2
	[c3]			c3 -> class 3

In the case of a cone:

y = [pc]
	[bx]
	[by]
	[bh]
	[bw]
	[c1]			c1 -> blue cone
	[c2]			c2 -> yellow cone


Find large dataset of zoomed-in cone images and run ConvNet on it train for image classification

Split the large image into multiple smaller set of images, which will be fed into the trained ConvNet for image classification. Move window by a certain stride and repeat.

Use large size of window and run again through same image with certain stride.
